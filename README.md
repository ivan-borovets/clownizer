## Installation

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Download [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/ivan-borovets/clownizer/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml)
3. Download [`src/config.yaml`](https://github.com/ivan-borovets/clownizer/blob/master/src/config.yaml)
4. The project structure should be as follows:

```
    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
```
5. Set [the correct settings](#explaining-srcconfigyaml) in `src/config.yaml`
6. Restart Docker: 

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
7. Get app image:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose pull
    ```
8. Launch the app:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose run clownizer
    ```
9. Auth in Telegram (once)
10. Wait for message: `"Handlers are registered. App is ready to work"`. From this point on, the app will perform
    its task. `Ctrl+C` to stop execution

## Installation alternatives
1. Clone this repo

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/ivan-borovets/clownizer.git
    ```
2. Set [the correct settings](#explaining-srcconfigyaml) in `src/config.yaml`

### With Docker-Compose:
3. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
4. Restart Docker: 

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart docker
    ```
5. Build app image:

    ```shell
    sudo docker compose build
    ```
6. Launch the app:
    ```shell
    sudo docker compose run clownizer
    ```
7. Auth in Telegram (once)
8. Wait for message: `"Handlers are registered. App is ready to work"`. From this point on, the app will perform
    its task. `Ctrl+C` to stop execution

### With Poetry:
3. Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to set up a virtual environment. If Poetry is already installed in the
   root folder, try:

-   ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```
-   ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

Instead, you can set up venv using `pyproject.toml`

4. Run `src/main.py` with Python from venv
5. Auth in Telegram (once)
6. Wait for message: `"Handlers are registered. App is ready to work"`. From this point on, the app will perform
    its task. `Ctrl+C` to stop execution

## Troubleshooting installation
1. If `UserWarning: Can not find any timezone configuration, defaulting to UTC.` but correct log times are
      important, try:
   1. Choose your timezone from
        ```sh
        timedatectl list-timezones
        ```
   2. Set your timezone with
        ```sh
        sudo timedatectl set-timezone <your_timezone>
        ```
   3. `/etc/localtime` should appear (check with `ls /etc/localtime`)
